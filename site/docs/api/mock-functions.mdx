import { ObjectRenderer, FieldRenderer } from "@site/src/components/object-renderer";

import mock from "../../../docs/types/mock.json";

Mock functions allow stubbing and/or inspecting functions when testing.
This is especially used when unit testing, where you'll likely need to mock unrelated units of your code or code from other packages or libraries.allow

You can create a mock function with `lest.fn()`. If no implementation is given, the mock function will return `nil` when called.

## Reference
