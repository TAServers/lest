# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

While Total Anarchy Servers allows full freedom of speech and expression on Discord and in all of our game servers,
we do not tolerate unprofessional behaviour on GitHub.
GitHub is a place for collaboration and we cannot collaborate effectively if we do not show each other proper respect and act professionally.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct only applies to interactions on GitHub itself.
It does **not** apply to our game servers, Discord, or any future spaces we may eventually set up unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Enforcement

We cannot guarantee that this Code of Conduct will be enforced consistently at all times.
We're a small group of developers, we don't have a HR or moderation team to manage this for us.

If you feel that a guideline is being enforced _inconsistently_, then **please let us know**.
Similarly, if you're doing something that you think violates these guidelines but no one is explicitly stating that you are,
that does **not** mean that we are allowing you to do whatever it is you're doing.
