# Lest

Painless Lua testing providing an API similar to Jest's, and without external dependencies or reliance on Luarocks.

Lest is now nearing the stage where we can recommend using it in your own projects, however there's a few more things to do:

-   Finalise the local dev experience (this package is the main part of that!)
-   Replace the stop-gap GitHub action
-   Bring API documentation in-line with the implemented API
-   Write non-API documentation, such as a getting started guide
-   And finally, replace this readme
